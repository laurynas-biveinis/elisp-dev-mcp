* elisp-dev-mcp 1.2.0 (2026-02-10)

** New features

*** elisp-read-source-file now accepts library names
The tool can now accept library names (e.g., "subr", "mcp-server-lib")
in addition to absolute file paths. Library names are resolved using
Emacs ~locate-library~ and validated against the same security whitelist.
This makes it easier for AI agents to read built-in Emacs packages
without needing to first determine the Emacs installation path.

Examples:
- ~elisp-read-source-file "subr"~ - reads built-in subr.el
- ~elisp-read-source-file "mcp-server-lib"~ - reads installed package
- ~elisp-read-source-file "/absolute/path/file.el"~ - still works as before

This addresses GitHub issue #5.

* elisp-dev-mcp 1.1.1 (2026-01-09)

** Bug fixes

*** elisp-get-function-definition now handles compressed source files
The tool now checks for ~.el.gz~ files when the ~.el~ file doesn't exist,
mirroring the logic already present in ~elisp-read-source-file~. This fixes
retrieval of function definitions from compressed Emacs system files.

* elisp-dev-mcp 1.1.0 (2026-01-02)

** Bug fixes

*** elisp-read-source-file now uses standard package variables
The tool now checks ~package-user-dir~ and ~package-directory-list~ instead of
hardcoding ~/elpa/~ paths. This improves compatibility with different Emacs
configurations and package managers like Eask.

** New features

*** Configurable additional allowed directories for elisp-read-source-file
Added ~elisp-dev-mcp-additional-allowed-dirs~ custom variable to allow users
of alternative package managers (straight.el, elpaca, etc.) to configure
additional directories that ~elisp-read-source-file~ can access. The feature
maintains security through path normalization and validation while extending
functionality for custom package setups.
